# random

welcome to **random.bat**, the ultimate chaotic batch file. edit it, meme it, break it, whatever just don’t blame me if anything happens.

## what it is
- a random batch script with pranks, mini-games, random popups, and weirdness  
- pure entropy energy, no real purpose  
- safe-ish, but still: backup your stuff before running

## warning
this is chaos. may spawn popups, fake blue screens, or random noises. run responsibly.  

## fun stuff
- go wild with the code  
- add new random options  
- prank yourself, not the world  

## why i made this

honestly? i was bored. wifi was down. nothing else to do. so i made this chaotic batch file to mess around, prank myself, and waste a few hours. it’s pure randomness and dumb fun enjoy (or suffer) responsibly.
